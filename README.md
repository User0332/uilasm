# UILAsm - The Uncommon Intermediate Language Assembler

UILAsm allows programmers to write [UIL (Uncommon Intermediate Languge)](https://ulr-il.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in a visual format which it assembles into the binary UIL format. The binary format can then be compiled and run by the [ULR (Uncommon Language Runtime)](https://github.com/uncommon-language-framework/runtime/) JIT engine.
